# Introduction

Welcome to the Abulafia user guide.

This document is meant to get you up to speed so that you can use Abulafia within your project.

## What this guide is not

This guide does not contain an in-depth description of every feature and parser available in Abulafia. 
It is meant to provide enough information and background to get started, but is by no means a comprehensive guide.
The [reference](../reference) covers everything in much greater details.
